# QuickView PDF
QuickView PDF is a simply to use and feature rich PDF viewer, built in .NET for Windows 2002.

Using it is pretty easy: on the left, you have your Paragraphs. These are automatically generated inside a PDF, so every PDF you have that has chapters will show up accordingly in QuickView.

You can also go from page to page by writing in the number of the page you want to go on top, or just press the arrow keys on top.
Additional page controls include rotating a page, fitting the page to the width of the pdf or to the screen dimension, and of course zooming in or out.

QuickView PDF also includes a handy OCR (Optical Character Recognition), which lets you extrapolate text from PDF pages, and convert them into plain text that can later be copied.

Last but not least, if you have any images that need to be converted into a PDF, e.g. images from a digital camera/camcorder, or a scanner, you can do that directly in QuickView PDF.

You can also decide how the pages should be formatted, if to make it recognised by OCR or not, and even if you want it to be encrypted or not.
